 - improve location setting for heap allocations (BIG) (possiblyrequire bit arene to know which spots are taken)
 (the algorithm is good but not optimized and dosent support edge cases like out of bounds)
 - implement pointers for heap (with arrows)
 - add ability to move around heap blocks with mouse
