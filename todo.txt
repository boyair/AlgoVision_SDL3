 - fix current bug with calling main

// probably wont be done
idea for spacefinder (possible because places are set before the user can move blocks arount and the structure wont collapse):
tagged union step (need a better name) {
 rect: *rectinfo,
 free: void,
 blocked: void,
}

struct rectinfo{
rect: Rect
distance_from_center: f32 / f64
const up: step
const down: step
const left: step
const right: step

fn traverse(self)
{
//find nearest to center (maybe consider size too)
run traverse(nearest) recursively until found free.
// can be modified to create cool patterns
}
}
